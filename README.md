# Texture Grabber

---

## What is it?

**Texture Grabber** is a Fabric mod for **Minecraft 1.20.1+** that automatically **extracts and saves all applied textures** from your gameâ€™s resource packs.

---

## Features

- Dumps **all textures** currently applied by the client
- Saves them neatly into `config/textures` folder
- Works with **vanilla** and **custom resource packs**
- Useful for **texture artists, modders, and pack developers**

---

## How it works

On client startup, the mod scans **all active resource packs** and extracts every texture resource it finds. These textures are then copied into your local `config/textures` directory for easy access and editing.

---

## Why use it?

- Quickly **backup your textures**
- Explore textures from different resource packs without opening Minecraft
- Use as a **reference or base** for your own texture packs

---

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader for Minecraft **1.20.1 or higher**
- Compatible with most resource packs and mods that modify textures
